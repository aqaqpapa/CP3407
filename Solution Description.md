## 🚀 Iterative Development and Delivery

This project followed an **iteration-based development approach**, meaning we delivered working features in small, manageable stages. Each iteration focused on building what’s **needed**, finishing it **on time**, and keeping everything **within scope and effort**.

### ✅ What We Did in Each Iteration
At the start of each iteration, we:
- Listed the key features to work on (user stories)
- Estimated the time and effort needed
- Prioritized based on client needs

By the end of each iteration, we:
- Deployed the updated system to an online environment (e.g., [Render](https://render.com))
- Showed a working demo of the new features (e.g., user login, booking, provider profile)
- Collected feedback and made plans to improve or adjust things in the next round

### 🧪 Demo and Feedback Driven
After each deployment:
- We ran demos for users or team members to walk through the new features
- Feedback was gathered on both UI/UX and functionality
- Improvements were made right away or added to the next iteration’s tasks

This made sure we built a system that actually met user expectations—not just what we thought was right.

### 🖥️ Tech Stack and System Design
- **Frontend:** React – clean UI and responsive design
- **Backend:** Express.js with REST API, connected to MySQL
- **Database:** Tables for Users, Providers, Customers, Bookings
- **Deployment:** Backend on Render; frontend optionally on Vercel or GitHub Pages

The database schema supports full end-to-end booking logic, including role-based features for providers and customers.

### 📄 GitHub Documentation Pages
To help others understand and use the system, we added clear docs to GitHub, including:
- 🧩 System architecture diagrams (like ERD)
- 🔐 Auth and role-based access control logic
- 🧪 Testing details (unit tests + Postman tests)
- 🎨 UI screenshots and walkthroughs
- 🌐 Deployment guide and access links

This documentation helps both users and future developers get started quickly and understand how everything works.
