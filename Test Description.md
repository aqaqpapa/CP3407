# ðŸ§ª Test Project Summary

## âœ… Test 1: In-Code Unit Testing
Basic test code was added directly inside the backend project to verify key functionality such as database connection, user registration, and login logic. These tests ensure that core modules behave as expected under normal and edge-case inputs.
